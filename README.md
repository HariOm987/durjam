    Controls are in-game.<br></h3>

Each player controls 3 fighters. The goal is to either capture all the other towers or defeat the other team.

TO SELECT CHARACTERS: Press the up or down keys to change a character, and left and right to change which character is selected. When done, press the select key (either F, comma, or Z)
TO MOVE: Choose a player using the move keys, press the select key (either F, comma, or Z), and then use the move keys.
TO CAPTURE A TOWER: Move onto the space with the tower.
TO START A FIGHT: Walk into a player on the other team.
TO FIGHT: Press Z or X to attack (Different characters have different attacks)

Sometimes you will see a grey player icon with a plus sign. If you touch it, it will summon a defeated player from your team (not a new player).
