  <H1>Guard The Towers</H1>
  <h2>Round up someone to play with!</H2>
  <H3>Controls are in-game.<br></h3>
<p>
Each player controls 3 fighters. The goal is to either capture all the other towers or defeat the other team.
</p>
  <b>TO SELECT CHARACTERS:</b> Press the up or down keys to change a character, and left and right to change which character is selected. When done, press the select key (either F, comma, or Z) <br>
  <b>TO MOVE:</b> Choose a player using the move keys, press the select key (either F, comma, or Z), and then use the move keys. <br>
  <b>TO CAPTURE A TOWER:</b> Move onto the space with the tower. <br>
  <b>TO START A FIGHT:</b> Walk into a player on the other team. <br>
  <b>TO FIGHT:</b> Press Z or X to attack (Different characters have different attacks) <br><br>

Sometimes you will see a grey player icon with a plus sign. If you touch it, it will summon a defeated player from your team (not a new player).
